# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns through various visualizations.
### As I performed analysis on the Kickstarter data, I gained a couple key points of feedback to share with Louise. This will provide her the visibility and information she needs to understand the many trends found within the data sheet she shared. 

Attached are a two visuals created in the datasheet with feedback and insight. 

#### Outcome Based on Launch Date

#### Feedback
As seen in this line graph, there is a peak of success in the month of May through July. Based on this set of data, it would be well advised to start her theater campaign in this time period.

#### Count of Outcomes - Based on Great Britain Plays

#### Insight
As seen in this stacked bar chart, in Great Britain (GB) there is a grand total of 314 plays of which 238 were successful. There's a high probability if Louise persuded her theater campaign in the GB are she would be successful.
